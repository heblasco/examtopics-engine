Comments: omath 3 weeks, 5 days ago Selected Answer: A * Answer: A. Upgrade to Copilot Business * Explanation: Content exclusions are an enterprise-level feature available only in Copilot for Business/Enterprise, not in the Individual plan. * Why others are incorrect: Adding a .gitignore file (B) does not affect Copilot suggestions—it only affects Git version control. C and D are incorrect because organization owners or repo admins cannot configure exclusions unless the plan supports it (Business/Enterprise). E (#file Chat variable) is for referencing files in prompts, not for enforcing exclusions. upvoted 1 times ...

Comments: omath 3 weeks, 5 days ago Selected Answer: BC * Answer: ✅ B. If the user is in an organization that has content exclusions configured. ✅ C. If the content exclusion settings changed in the last 30 minutes or before that. * Explanation: B is critical because content exclusions only apply if the user belongs to an organization with those settings enabled. C matters because changes to exclusions can take time to propagate (usually up to 30 minutes). * Why others are incorrect: A is unrelated—Copilot server connectivity does not affect exclusions. D is incorrect—there is no “content exclusion team”; exclusions are managed at the enterprise level. upvoted 1 times ...
